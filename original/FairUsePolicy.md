The following limitations must be observed for `/sports` call:
-  Requests made for the `/sports`  must be restricted to once every 60 minute. List of sports does not change often. The count of active events is obsolete functionality, that will eventually be decommissioned.  

The following limitations must be observed per sport:
- Requests made for the `/fixtures` and `/odds` operation without the since parameter must be restricted to once every 60 seconds;
- Requests made for the `/fixtures` and `/odds` operation with the since parameter must be restricted to once every 5 seconds.
- Requests made for the `/leagues` must be restricted to once every 60 minute.
 


### Best practice
First issue a snaphost call (without the `since` parameter)  and continue with the delta cals (with the `since` parameter). This would result in faster response time and smaller response payload, as a result, client will have get the odds/fixtures updates faster.
